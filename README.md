Water is the most significant resource of life, crucial for supporting the life of most existing creatures and human beings. Living organisms need water with enough quality to continue their lives. There are certain limits of pollutions that water species can tolerate. Exceeding these limits affects the existence of these creatures and threatens their lives.

Most ambient water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and streams have specific quality standards that indicate their quality. Moreover, water specifications for other applications/usages possess their standards. For example, irrigation water must be neither too saline nor contain toxic materials that can be transferred to plants or soil and thus destroying the ecosystems. Water quality for industrial uses also requires different properties based on the specific industrial processes. Some of the low-priced resources of fresh water, such as ground and surface water, are natural water resources. However, such resources can be polluted by human/industrial activities and other natural processes.

Modeling and prediction of water quality are very important for the protection of the environment. Developing a model by using advanced artificial intelligence algorithms can be used to measure the future water quality.
